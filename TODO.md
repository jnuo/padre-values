# Project TODO List

- [ ] Fix the metric sorting side menu functionality on mobile web.
- [ ] Use localization files instead of hardcoded text in the codebase. Refactor and review existing code for this.
- [ ] Add last value date to the metric card in the grid box. Should also support an avg. view state such as "{n} values" meaning it's average of 3 different values in this timeperiod.
